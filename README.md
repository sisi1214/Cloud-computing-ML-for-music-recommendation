Project Summary

This project predicts user-song interaction using an LSTM-based neural network. It preprocesses music streaming data—including user, song, and membership features—by engineering relevant attributes (e.g., genre count, artist/composer/lyricist relationships, membership duration). The processed data is fed into a PyTorch LSTM model to classify user engagement. Training and validation metrics are visualized to evaluate model performance.
